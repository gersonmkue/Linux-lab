# Linux Lab - Infrastructure and Automation Foundations

This repository documents my hands-on learning and practical implementation of Linux system administration, Bash scripting, automation, and version control.

It serves as a technical lab where I build, test, and refine foundational infrastructure skills used in backend engineering, DevOps, and system administration. 

---

## Objectives

- Develop strong Linux system fundamentals
- Lear Bash scripting and task automation
- Understand filesystem structure and system operations
- Implement cron-based automation
- Use Git and GitHub for version control and project tracking
- Build a professional technical foundation

---

## Technologies Used

- Linux (Ubuntu)
- Bash scripting
- Git
- GitHub
- Cron (task scheduler)

## Purpose

This repository represents my progression in Linux and infrastructure engineering.

All scripts and configurations are created and tested in a real Linux environment.

This lab will continue to grow as I advance into:

- Advanced automation
- Docker
- Backend services 
- Infrastructure management
